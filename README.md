# OJT Part 2 - On-the-Job Training Repository

This repository contains learning materials, documentation, and practice projects for On-the-Job Training (OJT) Part 2.

## 📚 Overview

This is a collaborative learning repository where trainees document their learning journey and build practical projects. The focus is on backend development, real-time systems, and modern web technologies.

## 👥 Contributors

- **Anurag** - Learning materials and practice projects
- **Garvit** - Learning materials and practice projects

## 🎯 Learning Topics

The training covers a comprehensive backend development roadmap including:

### Core Technologies
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: async/await, Promises, ES Modules, Map, Set
- **Node.js**: Event loop, HTTP module, process management
- **Express**: Routing, middleware, request-response lifecycle

### Advanced Topics
- **JWT Authentication**: Token generation, verification, auth middleware
- **WebSockets**: Real-time bidirectional communication
- **Rooms/Channels**: Group communication and broadcasting
- **Redis**: Key-value storage, caching, Pub/Sub patterns
- **MySQL**: Relational databases, relationships, constraints, indexes
- **React Native**: Mobile integration with WebSocket

### Project Focus: Real-Time Polling System

The main project is building a live polling application with:
- User authentication (JWT)
- Real-time voting using WebSockets
- One-vote-per-user constraint
- Redis for fast data access
- MySQL for persistent storage
- Live result updates

## 📖 Documentation

Detailed documentation is available in the following files:

- **[Learning_Garvit/Topics.md](Learning_Garvit/Topics.md)**: Complete learning roadmap from beginner to project-ready
- **[Learning_Garvit/BackendStructure.md](Learning_Garvit/BackendStructure.md)**: Detailed backend architecture and folder structure

## 🚀 Getting Started

Each learning directory contains its own implementations. Navigate to the respective directory to explore:

```bash
# For Anurag's work
cd Learning_Anurag

# For Garvit's work
cd Learning_Garvit
```

## 📝 Learning Approach

1. **Study Core Concepts**: Start with JavaScript fundamentals and progress through the topics
2. **Understand Architecture**: Review the backend structure documentation
3. **Hands-on Practice**: Implement features incrementally
4. **Build Projects**: Apply learned concepts in real-world scenarios

## 🛠️ Technologies Stack

- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Cache**: Redis
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Real-time**: WebSockets (Socket.io)
- **Language**: JavaScript/TypeScript

## 📌 Project Goals

- Build production-ready backend applications
- Understand real-time communication patterns
- Master authentication and authorization
- Learn database design and optimization
- Implement scalable architecture patterns

## 🤝 Contributing

This is a learning repository. Each contributor maintains their own learning directory and is encouraged to:

- Document learning progress
- Share code implementations
- Add helpful comments and explanations
- Keep documentation up-to-date
